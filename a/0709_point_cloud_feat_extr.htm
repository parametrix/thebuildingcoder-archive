<h3>Point Cloud Feature Extraction</h3>

<p>I discussed 

<a href="0708_point_cloud_unit_conv.htm">
point cloud unit conversion</a> just

yesterday.
We can immediately follow up with some more hot news on point clouds: 

<p>The free technology preview of a

<a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/scan_to_bim">
point cloud feature extraction tool</a> for

Revit has been released on Autodesk Labs.

<!--
For your convenience, here is a copy of the information provided there:

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Point Cloud Feature Extraction for Autodesk<sup style="font-size:x-small">�</sup> Revit<sup style="font-size:x-small">�</sup> 2012 software is a free* technology preview that allows you to work with point cloud more easily in Revit.
This plug-in automatically extracts useful geometry features from point cloud of buildings and creates basic Revit elements to aid the building modeling in Revit.

-->

It allows you to work more easily with point clouds in Revit by automatically extracting useful geometry features from point clouds of buildings and creating basic Revit elements from them.

<h4>Tools Included</h4>

<p>Point Cloud Feature Extraction for Autodesk Revit 2012 provides the following tools to facilitate the point cloud editing:

<ul>
<li>Crop / Uncrop: Temporarily hide the points outside a rectangle or polygon
<li>Hide Point Cloud: Temporarily hide the whole point cloud object to facilitate the inspection of feature extraction results
<li>Adjust Axis: Transform the point cloud data so that a floor can be aligned with the XY plane and major walls are parallel to Z axis
</ul>

<p>Moreover, this plug-in includes some main features specifically for Revit so that the extracted features and geometry can be smoothly integrated into the BIM workflow:

<ul>
<li>Datum Extraction: Extract both level and orthogonal grid
<li>Site Extraction: Extract both terrain surface for ground surface creation and building footprint on terrain surface for building pad generation
<li>Wall Extraction: Extract both straight wall layout and arc wall
<li>Floor Extraction: Extract floor from selected points on the floor plan level
</ul>

<!--

<h4>Availability</h4>

<p>The Point Cloud Feature Extraction for Autodesk Revit technology preview is licensed for a limited term and for a particular territory as referenced in the End User License Agreement. The technology preview will operate until August 1, 2012.
