<p>Just a week later, Chuong Ho
presents <a href="https://revitai.chuongmep.com">Revit Gen AI (Alpha)</a> enabling you to transform your Revit workflow with AI-powered automation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revit Vibe Coding with AI is now in beta! 😊</p>
<p>We’re expanding features and super excited about what’s coming next! Here’s what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI-Powered Coding Assistance &ndash; Generate and refine Revit code effortlessly using natural language prompts.</li>

<h4><a name="3"></a> Revit MCP Connector</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> is
an open framework introduced by Anthropic to standardize the way artificial intelligence (AI) models like large language models LLMs integrate and share data from diverse sources.
It was announced in November 2024 and provides guidelines and structures for handling the contextual data used in AI-driven applications, e.g., specifications for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data ingestion and transformation</li>
<li>Contextual metadata tagging</li>
<li>Model interoperability across platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Just now, 2025-03-26,
also <a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/">OpenAI announced MCP support</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam <a href="https://x.com/sama">@sama</a> Altman says,
... people love MCP and we are excited to add support across our products.
available today in the agents SDK and support for chatgpt desktop app + responses api coming soon!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jean-Marc <a href="https://github.com/jmcouffin">@jmcouffin</a> Couffin, aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jmco1045">jmco</a>, shared a 90-second YouTube video demonstrating
a <a href="https://youtu.be/mUJGSjQHBm8">Revit MCP Test</a>,
showing a Revit API enabled MCP connector interactively manipulating the BIM.
He gives credits for most of the code
to <a href="https://github.com/revit-mcp/revit-mcp-plugin">revit-mcp-plugin</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/revit-mcp/revit-mcp">revit-mcp</a>.

Caoduro, Cesare <cesare.caoduro@aecom.com>
  Hi Jeremy hope to find you well.
  I am reaching out as I am thinking to create a tutorial on how to create an agentic RAG that is an expert in Revit APIs. As one of the sources for that RAG, I was hoping I could use your blog as a source.
  Before I go and do that, I wanted to. let you know and get your permission. If that’s ok, I will publish the entire process and cite you of course.
  After that the idea is to add more knowledge using the SDK documentation, and finally build a Revit addin that consumes that local model. Everything will be leveraging opensource or free for commercial use tools.
  What do you think? There is sooo much knowledge embedded in your work, that would just be nice to be able to access it at your fingertips 😊

</ul>
<p>Cesare explains:</p>
<p>With all the hype around LLMs, MCPs, RAG, and everything else you read in your LinkedIn feed, I also wanted to give my 2 cents.
I was looking at an automated way to pull the SDK documentation into a vector database, in a way that was useful.
As you know, the documentation comes as a <code>CHM</code> file that is basically a zip file with a lot of <code>HTML</code> in it.
Unfortunately, HTML files are very verbose and full of unwanted tags.
Markdown (<code>md</code>) files, on the other hand, are just text files with some unique syntax to apply styles.
They turn to be very good for embeddings.
So, I started to use out of the box Python libraries to convert HTML to markdown, but the problem is that the results were absolute rubbish.
One major issue (specifically with the Revit SDK documentation) is that it includes JavaScript that will be executed when you click on certain things in the page.
An example with the Revit documentation is the availability of multiple examples depending on the programming language of your choice (C#, VB, F#, etc.).
It took me a bit of sweating and a good amount of Cursor (if you don't know what it is,
check out <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor &ndash; The AI Code Editor</a>),
to come up with an approach to properly parse the <code>html</code> into <code>md</code> and maintain a decent format.
Without further ado, here is the code.
Test it and let me know!
If you like it, I can also publish a quick tutorial on how to get this to work with an LLM locally.</p>

<p>p.s.: I have also a version of the script that works in C# is someone is interested.</p>
<p>p.p.s: I have also a script to pulls the entire "The Building Coder" blog into RAG.
I did ask permission from @jeremytammik for this 🙂</p>
<p>Congratulations to Cesare on this nice project, and many thanks for sharing it.</p>
<p>I would definitely like to take you up on your offer to 'publish a quick tutorial on how to get this to work with an LLM locally'.
That would be brilliant!
Thank you!</p>
<p>Some further thoughts and questions that come to mind (most probably automatically answered by such a tutorial):</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried using
  the <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2025/02/tools-for-extensible-storage-and-oauth-auth0.html#5">Docling Markdown Generator</a>?
  Does it handle CHM?</li>
<li>What is you use case for the RAG? How do you feed this into your processing system? What system are you using it for?</li>
<li>LangChain provides several integrated CHM reader libraries, I believe, and can also generate a vector database right out of the box, afaik. How does this compare to your approach?</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="5"></a> AI Effect on Programming Jobs</h4>
<p>An interesting question for developers and a pretty convincing answer to it is discussed by the article
on <a href="https://seldo.com/posts/ai-effect-on-programming-jobs">AI effect on programming jobs</a>,
very clearly and convincingly discussing addition and consequences of LLM prompts the continuously evolving development stack:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/full_stack_develop_2025.png" alt="Evolving development stack 2025" title="Evolving development stack 2025" width="500"/>
</center></p>
<p>I love the caption explaining the source of this chart data: 'I made this up. There is no data.''</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a> Jupyter Interactive Graphs</h4>
<p>Just for my own notes, I also like this nice article with interactive graphs explaining
<a href="https://joe-antognini.github.io/astronomy/daylight">how fast the days are getting longer</a> showing how to make beautiful use of
a <a href="https://github.com/joe-antognini/joe-antognini.github.io/blob/master/assets/posts/daylight/Sunrise.ipynb">Sunrise.ipynb Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="7"></a> Art is Theft</h4>
<p>Closing words:</p>
<p>Pablo Picasso is widely quoted as having said that good artists borrow, great artists steal.</p>
<p>This quote was also a favourite of Steve Jobs who said he stole the concept of the Macintosh computer from a similar device shown at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center.</p>
<p>Just an interesting thought in the current context of AI and LLM training.</p>
