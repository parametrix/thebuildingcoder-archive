<!-- 1258163 [Opening family files] -->

<h3>Using Process.Start to Open a Project or Family</h3>

<p>Here is a question that comes up from time to time on how to open and display a project or family file in the Revit user interface.
I mentioned a workaround in the answer to a 

<a href="0214_detail_lines.htm">
comment by Nadim</a>,

and now I think it is time to promote this little information nugget to a proper post to make it easier to find.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I need to open and display an existing project or family in the Revit user interface.
I see that the NewFamilyDocument and NewProjectDocument methods create new documents but do not open them.
I tried to use the OpenDocumentFile method taking a document path name argument to open an existing project, but it does not display it in the user interface either, it only returns an in-memory version of the document.
I also implemented an event handler and verified that the OnDocumentOpen event is not triggered by it.
Is it possible to open and display a document in the Revit user interface, and if so, how, please?

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, correct, NewFamilyDocument, NewProjectDocument and OpenDocumentFile only create new or open existing documents for API manipulation. 
They do not display them in the user interface, only open them in the background in-memory, without the Revit user interface even being aware of it, which is why the event is not triggered either.
There is currently no API method at all to make a document current in the Revit user interface. 
There is a workaround, though, that several people have used successfully:
you can use Process.Start as described in the comments on

<a href="0008_debugging.htm">
debugging an add-in</a>. 

Here is a little console application demonstrating such a call:

<pre class="code">
<span class="blue">class</span> <span class="teal">Program</span>
{
&nbsp; <span class="blue">static</span> <span class="blue">void</span> Main( <span class="blue">string</span>[] args )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; System.Diagnostics.<span class="teal">Process</span>.Start( 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="maroon">&quot;C:/tmp/wall.rvt&quot;</span> );
&nbsp; }
}
</pre>

<p>This uses the existing instance of Revit if it is already running.
It also works fine to start up Revit if you replace the project file "C:/tmp/wall.rvt" by the Revit application executable, although in that case obviously no document is opened.
