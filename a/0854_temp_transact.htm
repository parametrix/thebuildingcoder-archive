Arnost Lobel Re: The Temporary Transaction Trick for Gross Slab Data

-->

<h3>Temporary Transaction Trick Touchup</h3>

<p>I mentioned a number of uses of the 

<a href="0851_gross_slab_boundary.htm">
temporary transaction trick</a> a

few days back.

<p>Autodesk's own Revit API transaction expert Arno&scaron;t L&ouml;bel has a very important point to add to that discussion:

<p>The procedure as described is not always going to work. 

<p>First of all, you need to regenerate manually before retrieving any modified geometry; even that is not always guaranteed to give you the accurate and proper geometry. 

<p>Many times you will need to actually commit the 'temporary' transaction, since that is the only way to guarantee that all changes propagate though the model. 

<p>In order to undo the temporary transaction, you need to enclose it within a transaction group and roll back that group at the end. 
It goes as follows:

<ol>
<li>Start a transaction group.
<li>Start a transaction
<li>Make changes.
<li>Commit the transaction
<li>Retrieve changed geometry
<li>Roll back the transaction group
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, all too many are unaware of the fact that it is safe to read a model only after regeneration, and sometimes only after committing the open transaction. 
This is not only related to the 'temporary transaction' trick, it is simply a matter of fact: one should query model geometry only between transactions, or at least after regeneration (and auto-joining, if appropriate).

<p>Many thanks to Arno&scaron;t for this important enhancement!

<h4>Cloud Based Team Foundation Service</h4>

<p>We have seen how 

<a href="0826_divide_parts_fsharp.htm#4">
Git and Github</a> can

simplify global source code management and sharing, and Victor demonstrates one aspect of this by regularly providing his samples such as the 

<a href="0853_revit_wcf_service.htm">
Revit external access demo</a> via 

that platform.

<p>As you obviously know, Autodesk is also driving hard and moving fast towards providing innovative and empowering cloud-based solutions, e.g.

<a href="https://360.autodesk.com">
Autodesk 360</a>,

<a href="http://www.autodeskplm360.com">
PLM 360</a> and

<a href="https://bim360.autodesk.com">
BIM 360 Glue</a>.

<p>Now Microsoft joined the club, announcing its own cloud-based software project management platform, e.g. for Visual Studio, the 

<a href="http://tfs.visualstudio.com">
Team Foundation Service</a>.

<p>You can sign up for a free preview account right away, if you are interested.
