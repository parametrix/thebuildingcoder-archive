Amir Dezfouli
CEO at BIMLOGIQ

I just wrapped up Autodesk DevCon 2025 in Amsterdam, the leading conference for developers and innovators building on Autodesk’s platform.

Raji Arasu shared a forward-looking vision: replacing traditional add-ins with intelligent agents. These agents would have well-defined skill sets, automating tasks across platforms and shifting us beyond point-and-click interfaces to more complex workflow automation. This aligns well with the broader movement in AI toward agent-based systems and enabling platforms.

Low-code and no-code tools powered by LLMs were a major focus. Anthony Sertorio gave a compelling presentation on how these systems can close skill gaps and automate complex workflows. In a related session, Gregory Fina and Petr Broz demonstrated how chatbots can be used for data access and calculations.

Another clear direction was breaking down data silos. Many tools are now built for cloud-native environments—particularly Autodesk Platform Services. The new Autodesk Assistant reflects this shift, allowing users to access data through natural language.

A personal highlight was meeting Jeremy Tammik, whose work on the Revit API has been a long-standing source of inspiration. Some of the ideas he’s shared over the years have been particularly helpful in how we approach no-code automation in tools like BIMLOGIQ Copilot.

In one session, a poll asked: “If you could fix one issue in drawings, what would it be?” The top responses—cross-disciplinary mismatches, incorrect dimensions, and annotation clutter—highlight persistent pain points in the industry. These are exactly the kinds of challenges we’ve been tackling with AI-driven tools like Smart Annotation and vertically integrated automation solutions.

While general-purpose foundation models are driving progress, there’s still a gap when it comes to models tailored specifically for AEC. Vertical AI—deeply embedded in domain workflows—feels like the next frontier.

Meeting the legendary Jeremy Tammik — seen here casually chatting with Lejla Secerbegovic — was a personal highlight.

🙏 I finally had the chance to thank him for jump-starting my career (and no doubt many others’) in coding against the Revit API.

💡 If you've ever dabbled in hashtag#RevitAPI, you probably owe a nod to hashtag#TheBuildingCoder.

Dear Jeremy, sorry that I missed to sign the kudos-board re your retirement (I was off for a bit and also have a new job/role in AEC data team, now working from Croatia), so pls accept the warmest wishes for the happy and most deserved period which I'm sure you'll be a master of enjoying :wink: It was such a pleasure working with you and knowing your enthusiasm and passion you put into the blog and generally helping our 3rd party developers! Hopefully, our paths may cross again (visiting Croatia soon :blush:?), let's try to stay in touch (miro5@btinternet.com, +44 7921 492 808) and all the best once again.

 Raji Arasu
Raji Arasu, Chief Technology Officer, EVP at Autodesk shared a post: Just wrapped an inspiring week at TechX—our internal, employee-driven conference in Las Vegas—where we brought together over 1,000 Autodeskers in person, and many more virtually. TechX is all about investing in ourselves—connecting with peers, learning from experts, and sparking the kinds of conversations that move us forward. When you bring together thousands of product development professionals with intention, amazing things happen: ideas flow, decisions get made, and alignment happens in real-time (not over five days of email or Slack threads). This year, we focused on what matters most: building great technology and empowering the people who build it. I’m coming out of this week energized and committed to creating more of these meaningful, high-impact moments, because the momentum we build here lasts long after the conference ends. #Autodesk #TechX #Innovation #Leadership #Teamwork #ProductDevelopment
