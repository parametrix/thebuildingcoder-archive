<h3>Model Elements Revisited</h3>

<p>Scott Conover responded with a wealth of ideas to yesterday's 

<a href="0453_model_elements.htm">
model element selection</a> discussion, 

which in turn has gone through numerous previous iterations, so this really seems like an endless theme.

<p>Actually it is not even yesterday's, yet, it is still today's.
We both wanted to fix it fast.

<p>Here are Scott's comments and suggestions:

<p>First, on the original solution:

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="teal">IList</span>&lt;<span class="teal">Element</span>&gt; found
&nbsp; &nbsp; = collector
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .WhereElementIsNotElementType()
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .WhereElementIsViewIndependent()
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .WherePasses( <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="teal">LogicalOrFilter</span>(
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="teal">ElementIsElementTypeFilter</span>( <span class="blue">false</span> ),
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="teal">ElementIsElementTypeFilter</span>( <span class="blue">true</span> ) ) )
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .ToElements();
</pre>

<p>The WherePasses clause is totally unnecessary.  
I know this is the 'original' example, but I certainly hope that nobody copies this for further use.

<!--
[SC1]I dont know if this is necessary for your followup  I was kind of hoping you would edit the original post (at least add a comment around that set of lines indicating it is not useful).
-->

<p>Your 'first solution' post from 2009 appends filters to each other one at a time.  
Our new LogicalOrFilters support more than two inputs, so it should actually be updated to make more efficient use of 2011 filtering.

<!--
[SC2]We could definitely mention it.  Again, is it more useful to go back and edit the original post, or at least put this note there as well?  What is the correct bloggers etiquette for this?  To me, I prefer to view your blog as a resource for searching for useful techniques rather than a sequential time-based set of posts which may grow out-of-date; not sure if this is what you intend.
-->

<p>Regarding your second solution regarding HasMaterialQuantities &ndash; I guess it may not find all required elements.  
Furniture, for example, doesn't have material quantities, but it is a physical element in the model.  

<p>Another solution might be:

<ul>
<li>Start temporary transaction
<li>Create a default 3D view
<li>Create FilteredElementCollection on view elements.
<li>Apply WhereElementIsNotElementType
<li>Iteration
<li>Rollback to remove created view
</ul>

<p>Since it seems that 3D elements are what is wanted here, all elements visible in the new (unfiltered) 3D view are targets.

<p>Finally, the final solution contains a redundancy:

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="teal">FilteredElementCollector</span> collector 
&nbsp; &nbsp; = <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="teal">FilteredElementCollector</span>( doc );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; collector
&nbsp; &nbsp; .WhereElementIsNotElementType()
&nbsp; &nbsp; .WhereElementIsViewIndependent()
&nbsp; &nbsp; .ToElements();
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">foreach</span>( <span class="teal">Element</span> element <span class="blue">in</span> collector )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// . . .</span>
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<p>The redundancy consists in the call to ToElements.
It executes the filter over the document and returns all found elements in a collection.  
Foreach over the collector does the same execution a second time.  
You should either skip the ToElements call (which is what I would do), or declare a local IList<Element> to hold the return of ToElements and run foreach over that.

<!--
[SC3]This you are welcome to call attention to in this post.  But perhaps it should also have a note in the previous post.  See above.
-->

<p>Many thanks to Scott for this valuable feedback!
