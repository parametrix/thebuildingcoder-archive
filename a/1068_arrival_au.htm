<h3>Arrival at AU and The Story of Stuff</h3>

<p>I arrived safe and sound at AU.</p>

<p>Last week was pretty hectic with preparations for both AU and DevDays, and I never got around to writing anything here.</p>

<p>The weekend was also pretty full.</p>

<p>Unlike previous years, I did not leave Europe until the last possible moment, so no visit to the desert for me this time around.</p>

<p>The reason was my friend Sonja, who invited 100 friends to a half-day 'Be the Change' or

<a href="http://www.uptous.org/symposium">Awakening the Dreamer Symposium</a>

on Saturday afternoon along the lines of

<a href="http://www.pachamama.org">The Pachamama Alliance</a>.</p>

<p>The twenty-minute

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/storyofstuffproject">Story of Stuff</a> presents

a summary of some of the aspects we looked at together.</p>

<p>It was very inspiring, alhtough I personally still think I lead a pretty sustainable everyday life.</p>

<p>It felt a bit unsustainable to go off and fly across the Atlantic Ocean the very next day, though.</p>

<p>Anyway, I arrived safe and sound, the DevDay conference is about to begin, and I am looking forward to seeing all of you Revit developers face to face in the next few days!</p>
