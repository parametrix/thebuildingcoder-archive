<h3>Add Reference Points Read From CSV File</h3>

<p>For your convenience and my own future reference, here is a summary of a recent 

<a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Revit-API/reading-a-csv-file-code-evolved/td-p/3303833">
conversation</a> with 

Dermott Mcmeel and a pointer to his

<a href="http://vimeo.com/36167862">
video of the resulting add-in in action</a>.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I'm using this

<a href="http://nmillerarch.blogspot.com/2010/01/streaming-grasshopper-points-into-revit.html">
wicked tutorial</a>

as a basis for a plug-in that will read info out of a CSV file. 
However, it's a few years old and from what I gather some of the definitions have been redefined our outdated. 
I've done the 'First Revit API plug-in tutorial' and am stoked about my success. 
But I'm new to VB and C#, so I was wondering if anyone has updated info? 
Or could point out changes and where updated info might be found?

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I converted the 

<a href="http://nmillerarch.blogspot.com/2010/01/streaming-grasshopper-points-into-revit.html">
VB code to read a CSV file and generate Revit reference points</a> to

C# for you:

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="blue">string</span> filepath = <span class="maroon">&quot;insert file path here&quot;</span>;
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">if</span>( <span class="teal">File</span>.Exists( filepath ) )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">StreamReader</span> s = <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="teal">StreamReader</span>( 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; filepath );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">while</span>( -1 != s.Peek() )
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">string</span> line = s.ReadLine();
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">string</span>[] data = line.Split( 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="blue">char</span>[] { <span class="maroon">','</span> } );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">XYZ</span> p = app.Create.NewXYZ( 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">double</span>.Parse( data[0] ), 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">double</span>.Parse( data[1] ), 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">double</span>.Parse( data[2] ) );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">ReferencePoint</span> rp = doc.FamilyCreate
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .NewReferencePoint( p );
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> The code is very much appreciated. 
I am however having some trouble pasting it into the right context... 

<p>I've tried some remedial trouble shooting, but as I fix one error it creates another one. 

<p>I pasted the code straight into a blank C# class library template (as per Revit API tutorial 1) but get lots of errors &ndash; I assume I'm making a stupid mistake in the syntax but can't figure it out. 
Any help appreciated... and again thanks for the helping hand.

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Please work through one of the getting started tutorials first, before even thinking about CSV:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="0661_getting_started_2012.htm">
Getting started with the Revit API</a>

<li>
<a href="0703_training_prep.htm">
Preparing for a hands on Revit API training</a>
</ul>

<p>Then you will have a reliable working skeleton in place and almost certainly gotten a better hang of it.

<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thanks for all your help!

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For the sake of completeness, here is

ReadCsvPoints.zip</a> containing

Jeremy's C# version (and complete Visual Studio solution with add-in manifest) of an add-in to read point data from a CSV file and generate Revit reference points from it, and a snapshot of Dermott's

<a href="zip/ReadCsvPointsDm.cs">
WIP C# code</a> (work in progress).

<p>Many thanks to Dermott for the interesting topic, his research, and sharing the code!
