<!-- Chuck Dodson FW: I cannot load this family -->

<h3>A TXT File may be a Type List</h3>

<p>Here is a short note on a little issue to be aware of by Chuck Dodson of

<a href="http://www.sgadesigngroup.com">
SGA Design Group</a>:

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am stuck trying to figure out the meaning of this error message:</p>

<center>
<img src="img/txt_type_list_err.png" alt="TXT type list error message"/>
</center>

<p>I am creating a family in code.
I get the same problem if I create it manually.

<p>Do you have any idea what the message is saying?

<p>Looking online, I find comments about Shared Parameter file corruption, but I'm not using any.

<p>The odd thing is, if I rename the family, it loads fine.  
I can drag it from explorer; fine.  
I can load it from the open family file; fine.  
But if I use the Load Family button, I get the message, although it does actually load.

<p>Any ideas?

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I solved this.  

<p>I was writing a text file (.txt) in the same folder that my families were being created in.  
For some reason, Revit assumes it is a shared parameter file.  

<p>I changed the filename extension of the ASCII files I was writing to DEF instead of TXT and the problem is solved.  

<p>The '(' in the message above is a reference to a parenthesis starting on the first line of the text file.

Thought you might want to know.

<p>Jeremy adds: yes, I did know, in fact, and so do most family developers, but possibly a number of API newbies do not, so I am sure that this is information worth publishing and sharing. 
Thank you very much for that, Chuck!
