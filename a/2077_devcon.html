<h3>AI Agents and Selfies at DevCon 2025</h3>
<p>DevCon 2025 Amsterdam was a great success.
I am recuperating today and heading home by train tomorrow.
It was my last Autodesk event, and my time with Autodesk is nearing its end.
It was wonderful to see some many longstanding partners and hear about all your wonderful projects and visionary plans.</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a> Main Topic: Agents Using Data</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-dezfouli-55a79b32/">Amir Dezfouli</a>, CEO of <a href="https://bimlogiq.com/">Bimlogiq</a>,
succinctly summarised the main technical topics
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amir-dezfouli-55a79b32_i-just-wrapped-up-autodesk-devcon-2025-in-ugcPost-7330996207936344064-kfqX">on LinkedIn</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raji Arasu shared a forward-looking vision: replacing traditional add-ins with intelligent agents. These agents would have well-defined skill sets, automating tasks across platforms and shifting us beyond point-and-click interfaces to more complex workflow automation. This aligns well with the broader movement in AI toward agent-based systems and enabling platforms.</p>
<p>Low-code and no-code tools powered by LLMs were a major focus. Anthony Sertorio gave a compelling presentation on how these systems can close skill gaps and automate complex workflows. In a related session, Gregory Fina and Petr Broz demonstrated how chatbots can be used for data access and calculations.</p>
<p>Another clear direction was breaking down data silos. Many tools are now built for cloud-native environments—particularly Autodesk Platform Services. The new Autodesk Assistant reflects this shift, allowing users to access data through natural language.</p>
<p>A personal highlight was meeting Jeremy Tammik, whose work on the Revit API has been a long-standing source of inspiration. Some of the ideas he’s shared over the years have been particularly helpful in how we approach no-code automation in tools like BIMLOGIQ Copilot.</p>
<p>In one session, a poll asked: “If you could fix one issue in drawings, what would it be?” The top responses—cross-disciplinary mismatches, incorrect dimensions, and annotation clutter—highlight persistent pain points in the industry. These are exactly the kinds of challenges we’ve been tackling with AI-driven tools like Smart Annotation and vertically integrated automation solutions.</p>
<p>While general-purpose foundation models are driving progress, there’s still a gap when it comes to models tailored specifically for AEC. Vertical AI—deeply embedded in domain workflows—feels like the next frontier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd like to add that Raji also specifically highlighted that the importance of API documentation and end user interfaces may shrink, while the importance of <u>clearly defined and completely self-documenting functionality and components</u> might grow substantially.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Given clearly defined self-contained functionality with self-documenting interfaces, AIs can figure out for themselves the most effective ways to address a given step in a complex task and automatically build or configure appropriate agents and workflows to make use of such components with very little human intervention, or none at all.</p>
<p>Another vision of this trend and possible outcomes is discussed in depth by Rob Walling in his great nine-minute video
on <a href="https://youtu.be/JGqvd10ZG8U">AI agents vs SaaS &ndash; who wins the future of software?</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="2.1"></a> Cyrille's Summary of Day Two</h4>
<p>Cyrille Fauvel also shared
a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cyrillefauvel_autodeskdevcon-ai-sustainability-activity-7330861930187739136-mn3_">blurb summarising day two</a> underlining
the above &ndash; although, I must admit, it looks and sounds rather AI-generated to me
&ndash; bar the personal note at the end &nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>The second day of <strong>Autodesk DevCon Europe 2025</strong> was nothing short of inspiring!
The keynote focused on how <strong>AI is revolutionizing industries</strong> while driving <strong>sustainability</strong> &ndash; and at the heart of it all? <strong>Data</strong>.</p>
<p>AI is no longer just a tool for automation; it's a <strong>game-changer</strong> for industries looking to optimize workflows, reduce waste, and make smarter decisions.
From <strong>predictive insights</strong> in manufacturing to <strong>energy-efficient designs</strong> in architecture, AI is helping businesses stay ahead of industry demands while <strong>bolstering sustainability efforts</strong>.</p>
<p>But AI is only as powerful as the <strong>data</strong> it learns from.
The ability to <strong>leverage design and make data</strong> is what enables AI to <strong>automate tedious tasks</strong>, <strong>augment creative exploration</strong>, and <strong>analyze project data</strong> for better outcomes.
Companies that effectively harness their data are <strong>leading the charge</strong> in sustainability, using AI to <strong>reduce carbon footprints</strong>, <strong>optimize material usage</strong>, and <strong>assess environmental impact</strong>.</p>
<p>As AI continues to evolve, the <strong>importance of data</strong> will only grow.
Organizations that invest in <strong>data-driven strategies</strong> today will be the ones shaping a <strong>more sustainable, efficient, and innovative future</strong> tomorrow.</p>
<p>On a personal note, <strong>sustainability has always been a priority for me</strong>.
Fifteen years ago, I invested time and effort into making my home more environmentally friendly, and the journey is far from over.
Whether it's improving energy efficiency, reducing waste, or integrating smarter solutions, I'm constantly working on ways to make my living space more sustainable.
Marie, my partner in life, keep telling me that our house is not a research laboratory 😇
This keynote reinforced just how vital it is to <strong>keep pushing forward</strong>, leveraging both technology and data to build a better future.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on AI’s role in sustainability? Let’s discuss!</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> Kean's Event Overview</h4>
<p>Kean Walmsley presents an overview of the event in his article
on <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/05/devcon-europe-2025-in-amsterdam-days-1-2.html">DevCon Europe 2025 in Amsterdam &ndash; Days 1 and 2</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a> Teammate Monster Selfies</h4>
<p>My main occupation was shaking hands and posing for selfies, cf., <a href="#5">below</a>.</p>
<p>After closing, the team picture of the entire Autodesk DevCon team was spontaneously gate-crashed by my crazy genius colleague Michael Beale for this super monster selfie &ndash; with me grinning my head off in the brownish-orange shirt in the midlle:</p>

</center></p>
<p>That animated all of us and liberated some of the pent-up energy from these inspiring days and meetings:</p>

Dear Jeremy, sorry that I missed to sign the kudos-board re your retirement (I was off for a bit and also have a new job/role in AEC data team, now working from Croatia), so pls accept the warmest wishes for the happy and most deserved period which I'm sure you'll be a master of enjoying :wink: It was such a pleasure working with you and knowing your enthusiasm and passion you put into the blog and generally helping our 3rd party developers! Hopefully, our paths may cross again (visiting Croatia soon :blush:?), let's try to stay in touch (miro5@btinternet.com, +44 7921 492 808) and all the best once again.

 Raji Arasu
Raji Arasu, Chief Technology Officer, EVP at Autodesk shared a post: Just wrapped an inspiring week at TechX—our internal, employee-driven conference in Las Vegas—where we brought together over 1,000 Autodeskers in person, and many more virtually. TechX is all about investing in ourselves—connecting with peers, learning from experts, and sparking the kinds of conversations that move us forward. When you bring together thousands of product development professionals with intention, amazing things happen: ideas flow, decisions get made, and alignment happens in real-time (not over five days of email or Slack threads). This year, we focused on what matters most: building great technology and empowering the people who build it. I’m coming out of this week energized and committed to creating more of these meaningful, high-impact moments, because the momentum we build here lasts long after the conference ends. #Autodesk #TechX #Innovation #Leadership #Teamwork #ProductDevelopment

Great to meet the legend - Jeremy Tammik! It was a pleasure to finally meet in person someone whose work has supported and inspired developers worldwide for years. Jeremy is not just an expert - he’s a true bridge between the Autodesk platform and the developer community. Thank you for everything you do! #AutodeskDevCon #JeremyTammik #AutodeskPlatform #DeveloperCommunity

🎤 #Autodesk #DevCon Day 1 Meeting the legendary Jeremy Tammik — seen here casually chatting with Lejla Secerbegovic — was a personal highlight. 🙏 I finally had the chance to thank him for jump-starting my career (and no doubt many others’) in coding against the Revit API. 💡 If you've ever dabbled in #RevitAPI, you probably owe a nod to #TheBuildingCoder.

Similar story here! Saying "thanks" to Jaremy was on my todo list for this event!

Jörg Pipo reacted to Sam Kadra's post: What an experience at #AutodeskDevCon2025 in Amsterdam! The sessions went far beyond expectations, real conversations, hands-on demos, and future-forward ideas around BIM, APS, digital transformation, automation, and data integration. It wasn’t just about learning; it was about reimagining how we build smarter, faster, and more connected. I’ve always found Petr Broz ’s sessions to be among the most insightful and this year was no different. His take on APS and how it’s changing the way we collaborate across platforms really hit home. I walked away with a head full of ideas and practical inspiration to bring back to our BIM IT workflows. Big thanks to the whole Autodesk team for making this event such a success. And a special shoutout to our Autodesk Customer Success Manager Melissa Böck, I really appreciated the thoughtful conversations and your constant support during the event. You brought clarity and practical insight to every topic we discussed and I’ve come away with plenty of ideas to explore! Let’s turn vision into action and build a future we’re proud of together.🚀 #SiemensEnergy #AutodeskDevCon2025 #FutureOfBIM #DigitalTransformation #APS #AI #DesignAutomation #ACC #Revit #DataExchange #Autodesk #Innovation #BIM #TechLeadership

Olivier MARTIN ARCAS
BIM software developer

Hi Jeremy,

We quickly met at Devcon this week. I want to thank you again for “The Building Coder”.

In 2012 I decided to make a career change and I joined one of the biggest French construction company as BIM Developer. Thanks to you I quickly increased my skills and I was able to provide efficient processes and related tools in the Autodesk ecosystem. Since, I never stopped coding.

I wish you all the best in your retirement.

Best Regards,

Jeremy Tammik

Dear Olivier, nice of you to drop by and thank you for your kind appreciation. I am glad I was able to make a difference! Best of luck and much success to you! Cheers, Jeremy.
