How to Debug Revit Plugins: Speeding Up Development
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-debug-revit-plugins-speeding-up-development-gette-erik-8usef/
January 29, 2025
> The Runner.txt file is a VBA script (Revit journal) that allows executing specific commands in Revit upon startup. Essentially, it can be used to trigger any sequence of actions automatically.
In the context of my article, this file is used to launch Revit without any third-party plugins, ensuring a clean environment for testing and debugging.
Interestingly, Revit generates similar log files for each session. These files can be read and analyzed, which opens up a range of automation possibilities. For example, in our workflow, we use these logs to orchestrate 10 running instances of Revit to export over 5,000 files into NWC format efficiently.
The use cases for this approach are vast, and I plan to explore them in more detail in future articles. Stay tuned! 😊

  Exploring Open Source & Local LLM Ollama for Design Metadata Querying in Autodesk Platform Services! 🤖
  I'm excited to share my recent experiment with an open-source project that brings Local LLM AI and Autodesk Platform Services (APS) together! You can choose any model from your localhost with free AI open source model, and use this chatbot for a wide range of purposes!
  This is just the first version of my hackathon project, and I’m excited about how it turned out. A huge thanks to Petr Broz for the repository and inspiration!
  Check out the video below to see the real-time speed response using LLM on a local machine with WSL. It’s fascinating how fast and efficient the response time is!

<blockquote>
<p>Figure 1: The length of tasks (measured by how long they take human professionals) that generalist autonomous frontier model agents can complete with 50% reliability has been doubling approximately every 7 months for the last 6 years. The shaded region represents 95% CI calculated by hierarchical bootstrap over task families, tasks, and task attempts. Even if the absolute measurements are off by a factor of 10, the trend predicts that in under a decade we will see AI agents that can independently complete a large fraction of software tasks that currently take humans days or weeks.</p>
<p>At current rates, we will have:
* 1 (human work-) day autonomy in (5 exponentials * 7 months) = 3 years (2028)
* 1 (human work-) month autonomy in "late 2029" (+/- 2 years, only going for human working hours)</p>
