<h3>Removing Extreneous Mac Architectures, Languages and Files</h3>

<p>Nature abhors vacuum, and every disk fills up.

<p>This Mac has a 500 GB SSD, which is great, but gradually getting cramped.</p>

<p>Looking around for some disk space management tools, I also happened to stumble across

<a href="http://monolingual.sourceforge.net">
Monolingual</a> and

made immediate and effective spontaneous use of it.</p>

<p>Mac programs come with bundled resources for multiple PC architectures and languages.</p>

<p>Monolingual is a program for removing unnecessary resources in order to reclaim several hundred megabytes of disk space.</p>

<p>It does exactly what it promises fast and effectively with zero hassle.</p>

<p>I first removed unneeded architectures from my installed program resources:</p>

<img src="img/monolingual_1.png" alt="Unused architecture resources" width="400"/>
</center>

<p>That saves a modest 30 MB of disk space:</p>

<center>
<img src="img/monolingual_2.png" alt="Unused architecture resources consume 30 MB" width="400"/>
</center>

<p>Then I went for the list of languages, which is significantly longer:</p>

<center>
<img src="img/monolingual_4.png" alt="Unused language resources" width="400"/>
</center>

<p>Monolingual is clever enough to automatically uncheck all the languages that I currently have in use in my personal language settings from the list.</p>

<p>That saves 1.7 GB of disk space:</p>


<p>This is a pretty worthwhile result for a two-minute installation and two-minute execution process.</p>

<p>Add ten minutes of documentation time to that, and this is what you get.</p>

<p>I wish you a pleasant Sunday!</p>

<p>The weather here is pretty dreary, cold and windy, in case you hadn't guessed... :-)</p>

<h4>Lifehacker and Disk Inventory X</h4>

<p>While I was at it anyway, I also looked for a disk analyser.

<p>I chanced upon a very illuminating and well-written

<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5915508/the-best-disk-space-analyzer-for-os-x">
article by lifehacker</a> recommending

<a href="http://www.derlien.com">
Disk Inventory X</a>,

which I downloaded and tested.

<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a> looks pretty useful and competent in general, by the way.

<p>Disk Inventory X produces an extremely clear overview of the disk usage:</p>

</center>

<p>Highly recommended, judging from my first impression.</p>

<p>It will still take some time and effort to explore exactly where I can efficiently save space, though...</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter I can report that I found some quick candidates such as the GarageBand support libraries, accounting for 1.4 GB of space, and XCode.
I was forced to install it to obtain some libraries and Unix development tools, but I don't really need XCode itself, and it takes up over 3 GB.</p>

<p>Those are some significant savings...</p>
