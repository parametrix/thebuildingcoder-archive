<p>Here is our Valentine's Day present for you, an invitation to our bi-annual AEC DevCamp:

<p>Are you interested in customizing, extending or integrating with Revit, Civil 3D, Navisworks, the Autodesk BIM 360 vision, Vault Collaboration AEC, Revit Server, new web services and mobile technologies, and more?

<p>If so, then the Autodesk AEC DevCamp is for you!  

<ul>
<li>When: June 6-7, with a DevLab on June 8
<li>Where: Boston, Massachusetts &ndash; near Autodesk's AEC Division headquarters
<li>Cost: early bird discount fee of US $500 valid to April 30, 2012, thereafter US $600 
</ul>

<p>The two day <b>DevCamp</b> offers training for beginners and experts on the APIs of each of the products listed above. 
You get to talk to Autodesk product management and engineering staff and meet fellow developers like you.  
There is also a Business Development track for those steering their company's strategic direction and investments as well as Autodesk specific sales and marketing topics. 

<p>Following on from the DevCamp, we are holding a day-long <b>DevLab</b>. 
The DevLab has no agenda as it's all about spending quality time working with you on your specific needs and challenges.  
ADN DevTech engineers covering Autodesk technologies &ndash; Revit, Civil 3D, Navisworks and more &ndash; are available to help you &ndash; 1 to 1.  
Bring your laptop and work on your code as you'd normally do in your own office. 
With DevLab you have a team of experts available to review your code, answer your questions, and make suggestions.
