<h3>Finding a Development Partner</h3>

<p>I was able to recuperate a bit from the previous weeks' travels and conferences in Milan this weekend, where I did very little except feel exhausted and ill.
Now I am fine again, though, and arrived safely for the developer conference and DevLab here in Farnborough in the UK.
The plane last night was late, of course, so I checked in way after midnight, but at least we all made it here this year  :-)

<p>Now and then, people ask me how they can locate a Revit developer to implement something for them, either for personal use or as a commercial application.

<p>One thing that I can point you to is the official Autodesk list of ADN developer partners at

<a href="http://partnerproducts.autodesk.com">partnerproducts.autodesk.com</a> &gt; 

<a href="http://partnerproducts.autodesk.com/catalog/industry.asp?Industry=PSVCS">Professional Services</a>.

<p>Another place you can look and also post a request for proposals is the Revit API discussion forum at 

<a href="http://forums.autodesk.com">forums.autodesk.com</a> &gt; Autodesk Revit &gt; Autodesk Revit API.

<p>Then we have a number of well-known independent developers, many of whom have both asked questions and contributed solutions to this blog, such as 

<a href="http://redbolts.com">Guy Robinson</a> (NZ), 
<a href="http://www.cadworks.net">CADWorks</a>, 
<a href="http://nti.dk/forside.aspx">NTI CADcenter</a> and
<a href="http://www.cad-q.com">CAD-Q</a> (Scandinavia), 
<a href="http://www.team-solutions.de">GEM Team Solutions</a> (Germany),
BIMWare, 
CADSoft, 
etc.

<p>You can also obviously post a comment below and see whether anyone responds to that, regardless of whether 
you are offering some Revit API development service or if you are searching for some or have a RFP.

<!-- <p>You can also post a comment if you feel that I should have listed you explicitly above, especially if you have already contributed to the blog in the past  :-) -->

<p>Some additional general advice: when hiring someone to perform a service, you might want to ask for contact details of three prior customers of theirs, so that you can talk to them.
Hiring a consultant is not that much different from hiring an employee, so it is prudent to perform a careful interview and check the references.

<p>Obviously, check for existing built-in functionality and existing applications before you even start dreaming let alone thinking of creating a custom solution. 
<a href="http://bimapps.typepad.com">BIMapps</a> may help with the latter.

<p>Good luck!
