- The Bitter Lesson
  http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html
  > One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.
  > The second general point to be learned from the bitter lesson is that the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries. All these are part of the arbitrary, intrinsically-complex, outside world. They are not what should be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. Essential to these methods is that they can find good approximations, but the search for them should be by our methods, not by us. We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.

<h4><a name="3"></a> Retirement and Away on Leave</h4>
<p>My retirement is coming up, currently scheduled before the middle of next year.</p>
<p>Since I have heaps of unused accrued vacation that I need to consume beforehand, and not enough remaining working hours to do so, I am taking leave in November and December 2024.</p>
<p>So, I will be less active both here in The Building Coder blog and in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> for
the rest of 2024.</p>
<p>Happily, during that time, new growing capabilities offered by the AI LLMs may enable them to step in and help:</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a> ChatGPT for Q4R4</h4>
<p>Back in 2017, I pondered a question answering system for Revit API.
I called it <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/r4q4/">Q4R4</a>, short for <code>QA</code> <code>4</code> <code>RA</code>, aiming for a short yet globally unique term.
Here are some notes on that project:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>Since the advent of ChatGPT, I thought I might create a collection of Revit API questions and answers to feed a RAG-enhanced LLM system.
Currently, RAG in evolving further into GraphRAG, KnowledgeGraph, etc.</p>
<p>That would make sense if the Revit API knowledge that I wish to use was proprietary and not public.</p>
<p>Luckily, however, I have now spent over 15 years pushing hard to make all Revit API questions and answers publicly available.</p>
<p>Those efforts are now paying off, and there may be less need for my research and efforts to create a closed-loop RAG-base system; instead,
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/">ChatGPT now searches the live internet</a>,
including the Revit API discussion forum and the blog:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/chatgpt_revit_api.png" alt="ChatGPT knows the Revit API discussion forum" title="ChatGPT knows the Revit API discussion forum" width="800"/>
</center></p>
<p>I tested it on a real live forum question
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/rebar-cover-geometry-extraction-visualizing-using-c/m-p/13130442">rebar cover geometry extraction and visualisation using C#</a>.
The result is promising: ChatGPT was successful in answering the customer's question, cf.
the <a href="#4">first LLM forum solution</a> below.</p>
<p>So, possibly no need for RAG or any dedicated chat machine if you have the RAG sources on the public Internet.
Just use a generic AI that has up-to-date Internet access and tell it where to look for the answers.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a> First LLM Forum Solution</h4>
<p>This is the first AI LLM-generated <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> solution Q &amp; A:</p>

Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>Edited Question for ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>How can I use the Revit API to Extract and Visualize the rebar cover geometry given the host element?
I need to create curves with respect to the cover geometry.
This has been discussed in the Revit API discussion forum and by The Building Coder blog.</p>
<p><strong>Answer by ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>To extract and visualize rebar cover geometry using the Revit API, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access the Host Element: Start by getting a reference to the host element (e.g., a concrete beam or column) that has the rebar cover. This will allow you to access its geometry.</li>
<li>Retrieve Rebar Cover: The Rebar Cover in Revit is associated with the host element. You can use the RebarCoverType and Element properties to find the cover geometry. Use the Parameter named "Rebar Cover - Top Face," "Rebar Cover - Bottom Face," etc., depending on which faces you are interested in.</li>
<li>Get Geometry: Use the Options class to define your geometry extraction preferences (e.g., setting IncludeNonVisibleObjects if necessary). Then, use element.get_Geometry(options) to extract the geometry of the host element.</li>
<li>Filter Cover Faces: Once you have the geometry, filter for faces. You may use a combination of Face classes and methods to isolate the specific faces where the rebar cover is applied.</li>
<li>Determine Offset for Cover Geometry: Revit API does not provide a direct method to create cover geometry as objects. You can programmatically create cover lines or planes by offsetting the faces you extracted. Use the Face.ComputeOffset method if applicable, or manually offset by the cover distance specified by RebarCoverType.CoverDistance.</li>
<li>Create Curves: Using the cover distance and geometry faces, create curves. The Curve class in the Revit API can be used to create lines or arcs representing the boundaries of the cover.</li>
<li>Visualization: To visualize these curves in Revit, add them as model lines or use temporary graphics. You can use Document.Create.NewModelCurve for permanent lines, or TemporaryGraphicsManager to show temporary lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example Code:
here is a simplified code outline in C# to extract cover geometry and create curves around it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cs">using Autodesk.Revit.DB;
using Autodesk.Revit.UI;

public Result Execute(ExternalCommandData commandData, ref string message, ElementSet elements)
{
    Document doc = commandData.Application.ActiveUIDocument.Document;

    // Assume you already have the host element (like a structural element)
    Element hostElement = ... // retrieve your host element here

    // Get geometry options
    Options geomOptions = new Options();
    GeometryElement geomElement = hostElement.get_Geometry(geomOptions);

    double coverDistance = GetCoverDistance(hostElement); // retrieve cover distance from rebar cover type

    // Iterate through geometry to find the faces
    foreach (GeometryObject geomObj in geomElement)
    {
        Solid solid = geomObj as Solid;
        if (solid != null)
        {
            foreach (Face face in solid.Faces)
            {
                // Compute offset face or create curves around the face based on coverDistance
                List&lt;Curve&gt; coverCurves = CreateCoverCurves(face, coverDistance, doc);

                // Display curves in model (e.g., as model lines)
                using (Transaction tx = new Transaction(doc, "Create Rebar Cover Curves"))
                {
                    tx.Start();
                    foreach (Curve curve in coverCurves)
                    {
                        doc.Create.NewModelCurve(curve, sketchPlane);
                    }
                    tx.Commit();
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return Result.Succeeded;
}

<p>Additional References:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at The Building Coder blog by Jeremy Tammik. He often discusses geometry extraction, cover, and curve generation in Revit API.</li>
<li>The Revit API Forum also has discussions around extracting cover and rebar geometry.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach provides a general workflow and can be tailored based on the specific cover types and face orientations in your project.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong>
Thanks @jeremy_tammik,
I extracted the host geometry, using each face and the known Curve Distance I'm able to extract the geometry.
I faced an issue finding the curves of Cover from the face edgeLoops (x and y axis will return error).
In that case, first I used the edge curve to make an offset in Z direction and made the offset curve translation in Z direction (to eliminate X and Y axis error).
Below is the code i used to find the curve of an edgeLoop curve:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cs">Curve hostFaceCurveOffset = curve.CreateOffset(
  coverDist, XYZ.BasisZ); //to move horizontally
Curve hostFaceCurveTranslation = offset.CreateTransformed(
  Transform.CreateTranslation(
    new XYZ(0, 0, coverDist))); // To move vertically
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you for the confirmation, Thomas Tinu, thanks to ChatGPT for the research and answer, and thanks to the entire community for years of discussing questions and answers in public to feed the LLM!</p>

<h4><a name="7"></a> The Bitter Lesson</h4>
<p>Back to AI-related news, a succinct summary of one problematic aspect was provided several years ago by Rich Sutton
in <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">The Bitter Lesson</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.</p>
<p>The second general point to be learned from the bitter lesson is that the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries. All these are part of the arbitrary, intrinsically-complex, outside world. They are not what should be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. Essential to these methods is that they can find good approximations, but the search for them should be by our methods, not by us. We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="8"></a> Brain Drain: David vs Goliath</h4>
<p>I ran into <em>The Bitter Lesson</em> reading
about <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/10/17/training-data-scarcity-synthetic-quality-model-genai-ai/">Brain Drain: David vs Goliath</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are worries that GenAI systems may run out of fresh data as they scale.

<h4><a name="9"></a> AI Effects on Human Creativity</h4>
<p>New research presents interesting results
on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03703">human creativity in the age of LLMs: randomized experiments on divergent and convergent thinking</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Large language models are transforming the creative process by offering unprecedented capabilities to algorithmically generate ideas. While these tools can enhance human creativity when people co-create with them, it's unclear how this will impact unassisted human creativity. We conducted two large pre-registered parallel experiments involving 1,100 participants attempting tasks targeting the two core components of creativity, divergent and convergent thinking. We compare the effects of two forms of large language model (LLM) assistance -- a standard LLM providing direct answers and a coach-like LLM offering guidance -- with a control group receiving no AI assistance, and focus particularly on how all groups perform in a final, unassisted stage. Our findings reveal that while LLM assistance can provide short-term boosts in creativity during assisted tasks, it may inadvertently hinder independent creative performance when users work without assistance, raising concerns about the long-term impact on human creativity and cognition.</p>

<h4><a name="10"></a> HTML for People</h4>
<p>Moving away from both AI and the Revit API, here is a neat introduction
to <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com/">HTML for people</a>,
showing how to create and publish a web site from scratch, right now, for anyone.</p>
<h4><a name="11"></a> UN Climate Change Efforts Off Track</h4>
<p>Finally, unfortunately,
the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8yyle2eq2o">world is way off target in tackling climate change</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Greenhouse gas emissions:
  Right now, when the plans are added up, they indicate that emissions will likely fall by just 2.6% by 2030 compared to 2019.
  This is far short of the 43% reduction that scientists say will be needed by the end of this decade to keep the world on track for net-zero carbon by 2050.</li>
<li>Forest feedback loop:
  So, if the forests and the oceans become less able to soak up CO2, global warming could accelerate more rapidly.</li>
</ul>
