<h3>Element Intersection</h3>

<p>A common question when analysing a BIM is determining whether any of its elements intersect.

<p>This was actually surprisingly difficult to answer programmatically in Revit a few releases back, as some of the interesting uses of the FindReferencesByDirection method show, for example the FindColumns SDK sample.
Later, that method was enhanced to lead to FindReferencesWithContextByDirection.

<p>The FindColumns sample searches for intersections between walls and columns by shooting a ray along the wall centre line, raised above the bottom level by a foot or so, and detecting any columns hit by it.
One obvious problem with this approach is its inaccuracy &ndash; any column just partially intersecting the wall may easily be missed by the ray.

<p>A few years ago, that was the best an add-in developer could hope for, and things looked even worse before the advent of these methods.

<p>So what is the situation today?
In short:


<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can I programmatically detect whether two Revit elements intersect?


<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can now perform a Boolean operation on Revit element solids and determine whether they intersect using the BooleanOperationsUtils class ExecuteBooleanOperation method.

<p>Please note that the resulting intersection solid is transient, in-memory only.
It can be used for calculation and short-term visualisation using the analysis visualisation framework AVF, but it cannot be added to the Revit database or made persistent.

<p>This class was introduced in the Revit 2012 API, and the 

<a href="0580_revit_2012_api_webcast.htm">
associated webcast</a> showed 

it being used impressively in a much improved version of the FindColumns SDK sample.
This version determines the exact intersection solids between all columns and walls instead of roughly approximating the intersection detection by casting a single ray, and displays them to the user through AVF.

<p>The Boolean intersection demo is described in detail and the source can be downloaded from the discussion of a simpler derived sample

<a href="0694_avf_hilite_rooms.htm">
using AVF to highlight rooms</a>.

<p>Another example of making use of this class is given by the GeometryCreation_BooleanOperation SDK sample.

<p>Finally, here are two discussions on element intersection before the introduction of the BooleanOperationsUtils class, on
