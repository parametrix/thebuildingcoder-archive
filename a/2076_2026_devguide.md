  Jeff [JeffroH](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/15371876) [Hpad](https://github.com/Hpad) Hornsby:
  I'm surprised more developers aren't utilizing shared projects. Shared projects seem to offer the greatest flexibility, in my opinion.
  Maybe not too surprised since shared projects came out less than 10 years ago.
  The AutoCAD API adheres better to established API design principles, particularly in not breaking existing code(changing signatures, etc.), and works really well with shared projects for multiple year releases.
  Centralizing your code in a shared project and using each year's project solely for build configurations, references, build events, and related setup seems easier and more efficient in my opinion.
  If you want an example here are ExtensibleStorageManager & SchemaWrapperTools(referenced by ExtensibleStorageManager)projects from the SDK example ready to build for 2020-2025. All I did was take 2020 project and add conditional compilation symbols to separate code changes between the years
  https://github.com/Hpad/RevitSharedProject
  The only change is you will have to change build output path for the 2025 projects as the relative paths converted to full paths.
  If you want to add a 2026 project
  - Add new project using correct .NET framework(guessing .NET 8.0 for 2026)
  - Reference the RevitAPI.dll, RevitUIAPI.dll, the shared projects.
  - Add Release and Debug conditional compilations symbols
  - Update code with symbols(ex REVIT 2026) if required

  [substack](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/)
  on [MCP, A2A, and the Beginning of the End of Explicit Programming](https://youtu.be/cPdVbVx5Z3Q)
  My note on MCP: [How I Think About MCP: A Practical Guide to Tool Use in AI Agents](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/how-i-think-about-mcp-a-practical)
  Takeaways
  1. A New Software Substrate: Google’s A2A (agent-to-agent) protocol and Model Context Protocol (MCP) signal a shift from deterministic, pre-programmed systems to dynamic, emergent, agent-driven software architectures.
  2. MCP Enables Capability Descriptions: Instead of hardcoding instructions, MCP allows developers to describe tool capabilities in structured ways, enabling AI to figure out how best to use them.
  3. A2A Unlocks Agent Collaboration: A2A allows agents to discover, understand, and collaborate with other agents dynamically, forming workflows on the fly rather than following static rules.
  4. New Challenges in State, Cost, and Security: Agent-based systems raise complex issues around state management, resource consumption from reasoning overhead, and new security risks like authorization and auditability.
  5. Optimization Is No Longer Straightforward: Unlike traditional software where pathways are known, agent-based systems must optimize in unpredictable, dynamic contexts, requiring entirely new approaches.
  6. Open Standards for the Agentic Era: A2A is built on open, observable, and debuggable standards like HTTP and JSON-RPC, inviting broader ecosystem collaboration and development.
  7. Delegating to Intelligence, Not Software: The shift means intelligence becomes part of the software fabric. We no longer delegate tasks to predefined logic &ndash; we delegate them to autonomous agents capable of learning and adaptation.
  Quotes
  “We’re not just adding new features to the same old software &ndash; we’re fundamentally rethinking what software can be.”
  “Functionality isn’t just called, it’s negotiated now.”
  “MCP gives agents the ability to understand and use tools; A2A gives them the ability to work together.”
  Summary
  Google’s A2A protocol and Model Context Protocol (MCP) mark a profound shift in AI architecture, moving us from deterministic software to dynamic, agent-based systems. MCP enables AI to understand and use tools without explicit instructions, while A2A allows agents to discover and collaborate with one another. This paradigm demands rethinking state management, security, and optimization strategies. It’s not just a technical evolution—it’s a redefinition of how we build and scale intelligent software. We are entering a world where we delegate to intelligence itself, not just code.

It leverages a RAG system to provide the LLM with relevant context from the Revit API documentation, enabling it to understand and respond to Revit-specific requests more effectively.

Looking forward to seeing what the new exciting times will bring for me personally and for the world at large.
Above all, I'm looking forward to meeting you here today and tomorrow!

A thread that We already mentioned
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on the [optimal add-in code base approach to target multiple Revit releases](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/optimal-add-in-code-base-approach-to-target-multiple-revit/m-p/13614983).
It was resurrected
by Jeff [JeffroH](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/15371876) [Hpad](https://github.com/Hpad) Hornsby, who suggests:

Centralizing your code in a shared project and using each year's project solely for build configurations, references, build events, and related setup seems easier and more efficient in my opinion.
To demonstrate, I created
the [RevitSharedProject example of a Revit shared project](https://github.com/Hpad/RevitSharedProject).
I took the 2020 ExtensibleStorageManager and SchemaWrapperTools (referenced by ExtensibleStorageManager) projects from the SDK samples and made them ready to build for 2020-2025 by adding conditional compilation symbols to separate code changes between the years.
The only change is you will have to change build output path for the 2025 projects as the relative paths converted to full paths.

- Reference the RevitAPI.dll, RevitUIAPI.dll, the shared projects
- Add Release and Debug conditional compilations symbols
- Update code with symbols (e.g., Revit 2026) if required

This suggestion sparked some controversial discussion, with other developers disagreeing with this approach, so check out the original thread for the full view.

Many thanks to Jeff for raising this.

on [MCP, A2A, and the Beginning of the End of Explicit Programming](https://youtu.be/cPdVbVx5Z3Q):

My note on MCP: [How I Think About MCP: A Practical Guide to Tool Use in AI Agents](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/how-i-think-about-mcp-a-practical) takeaways:

####<a name="10"></a> AutoGenLib On-The-Fly Coding

More automatic code generation tools &ndash; Vibe coding on steroids:

[AutoGenLib](https://github.com/cofob/autogenlib) is a Python library that automatically generates code on-the-fly using OpenAI's API. When you try to import a module or function that doesn't exist, AutoGenLib creates it for you based on a high-level description of what you need.

- **Dynamic Code Generation**: Import modules and functions that don't exist yet
- **Context-Aware**: New functions are generated with knowledge of existing code
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add new functionality to existing modules seamlessly
- **No Default Caching**: Each import generates fresh code for more varied and creative results
- **Full Codebase Context**: LLM can see all previously generated modules for better consistency
- **Caller Code Analysis**: The LLM analyzes the actual code that's importing the module to better understand the context and requirements
- **Automatic Exception Handling**: All exceptions are sent to LLM to provide clear explanation and fixes for errors.
